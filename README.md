# Quiz
This is the second project of my studies in [Simplon](https://simplon.co/formation/developpeur-web-et-web-mobile/11). This quiz focuses on anime and manga. I developed it using Typescript to create user interaction. The project was built using npm and parcel.

### Home
Upon arriving on the website, the quiz rules are presented. There is a "Start" button that initiates the quiz.
### Questions / Answers
At the top of the page, the following information is displayed:
- Score
- Time
- Question number
For each question, the user is presented with 4 possible answers. They have 15 seconds to select one. To confirm their choice, they must click the "Submit" button. A correct answer earns 50 points, and there is no point deduction for incorrect answers. After submitting, the correct answer is displayed in green, while the other options are displayed in red.
### End
At the end of the quiz, a personalized message is displayed based on the score achieved.
